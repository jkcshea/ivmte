regressions for the IV-like estimands.}

effects.}

\code{\link{lists.mst}} on how to input the argument.}

\item{components}{a list of vectors of the terms/components from
the regressions specifications we want to include in the set of
IV-like estimands. To select the intercept term, include in the
vector of variable names, `intercept'. See
\code{\link{lists.mst}} on how to input the argument. If no
argument is provided, then}

\item{propensity}{formula or variable name corresponding to
propensity to take up treatment. If a formula is declared, then
the function estimates propensity score according to the
formula and link specified. If a variable name is declared,
then the corresponding column in the data is taken as the

be chosen from \code{linear}, \code{probit}, or \code{logit}.}

function for control group. Splines can also be incorporated
using the expression "uSplines(degree, knots, intercept)". The

by default.}

\item{m1}{one-sided formula for marginal treatment response
function for treated group. Splines can also be incorporated
using the expression "uSplines(degree, knots, intercept)". The
'intercept' argument may be omitted, and is set to \code{TRUE}

then the user can instead submit the value of the weight
instead of a function.}

\item{target.weight1}{user-defined weight function for the treated
group defining the target parameter. A list of functions can be
submitted if the weighting function is in fact a spline. The

instead of a function.}

\item{target.knots0}{user-defined set of functions defining the

estimating generalized LATE.}

equivalence. The threshold enters in multiplicatively. Thus, a
value of 0 corresponds to no violation of observational
equivalence, and the assumption that the model is correctly
specified.}

1] of the unobservable u used to form the grid for imposing
shape restrictions on the MTRs.}

obtain the bounds on the treatment effect.}

\item{point}{boolean, default set to \code{FALSE}. Set to
\code{TRUE} if it is believed that the treatment effects are
point identified. If set to \code{TRUE}, then a GMM procedure
is implemented to estimate the treatment effects. Shape
constraints on the MTRs will be ignored under point
identification.}

\item{point.itermax}{integer, default of 2. Maximum number of
iterations allowed for GMM estimation under point
identification. So default estimate is the two-step GMM.}

\item{noisy}{boolean, default set to \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE},

procedure. Set to \code{FALSE} to suppress all messages,
e.g. when performing the bootstrap.}

\value{
Returns a list of results from throughout the estimation
    procedure. This includes all IV-like estimands; the propensity
    score model; bounds on the treatment effect; the estimated
    expectations of each term in the MTRs; the components and
    results of the LP problem.
}
\description{
This function estimates bounds on treatment effect parameters,
following the procedure described in Mogstad, Torgovitsky
(2017). Of the target parameters, the user can choose from the ATE,
ATT, ATU, LATE, and generalized LATE. The user is required to
provide a polynomial expression for the marginal treatment
responses (MTR), as well as a set of regressions. By restricting
the set of coefficients on each term of the MTRs to be consistent
with the regression estimates, the function is able to restrict
itself to a set of MTRs. The bounds on the treatment effect
parameter correspond to finding coefficients on the MTRs that
maximize their average difference.
}
\details{
The estimation procedure relies on the propensity to take up
treatment. The propensity scores can either be estimated as part of
the estimation procedure, or the user can specify a variable in the
data set already containing the propensity scores.

Constraints on the shape of the MTRs and marginal treatment effects
(MTE) can be imposed by the user, also. Specifically, bounds and
monotonicity restrictions are permitted. These constraints are only
enforced over a subset of the data. However, an audit procedure
randomly selects points outside of this subset to determine whether
or not the constraints hold. The user can specify how stringent
this audit procedure is using the function arguments.
