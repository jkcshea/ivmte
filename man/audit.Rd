\description{
This is the wrapper for running the entire audit procedure. This
function sets up the LP problem of minimizing the violation of
observational equivalence for the set of IV-like estimands, while
satisfying boundedness and monotonicity constraints declared by the
user. Rather than enforce boundedness and monotonicity hold across
the entire support of covariates and unobservables, this procedure
enforces the conditions over a subset of points in a grid. This
grid corresponds to the set of values the covariates can take, and a
subset of values of the unobservable term. The size of this grid is
specified by the user in the function arguments. The procedure then
goes on to check whether the constraints are satisfied at points
off the grid. Any point where either the boundedness or
monotonicity constraints are violated are incorporated into the
grid, and the process is repeated until the grid incorporates the
entire support of the covariates, or until some a maximum number of
iterations is reached.
